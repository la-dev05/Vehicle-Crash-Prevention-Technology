# ðŸš— Vehicle Crash Prevention Technology

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a sensor-based system designed to enhance vehicular safety. A sensor, mounted on the vehicle, runs an algorithm to calculate the projected distance the vehicle will travel at its current speed.  

If another vehicle approaches from a different directionâ€”such as at an intersection, the system sends a real-time notification to both vehicles, prompting them to reduce speed and mitigate the risk of collision.

The folders **Sim 1** and **Sim 2** contain video simulations demonstrating the functionality of the proposed technology, along with the Python code used to generate the simulations.

## How does it work?

The device installed in both cars transmits a signal of a specific frequency around the vehicles, covering a radius of approximately 200 to 250 meters. When vehicles approach an intersection from different directions, and their signal radii overlap, the device runs an onboard algorithm to calculate their respective speeds.  

If the algorithm detects a risk of collision, it alerts both drivers, informing them whether they need to slow down and at what rate.
